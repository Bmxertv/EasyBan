# EasyBan

EasyBan is a Plugin to Simplify ban's on you Minecraft Server

## Installation

Download the plugin from [Github](https://github.com/Bmxertv/EasyBan). Now move
the `EasyBan-RELEASE.jar` into the plugin's folder of the server and state the server afterwards. As soon as the server is
started, a new folder named `EasyBan` will be created in the plugin's folder. In this folder you will find a `config.yml` now
you can start to set your ban reasons, and you can also set the format of all dates
here [DateTime Patterns](https://www.baeldung.com/java-datetimeformatter#dateFormatter).
